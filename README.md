This assignment is to make a website made with bootstrap elements. I added a header for the website page that is centered to catch the visitor's eye. The navigation bar for the page is at the top of the page. When the page is resized to a smaller screen it will collapse into a hamburger button that displays all the navigation links. My registration form has the first name and the last name side by side. Underneath where you put your name is the email address and password entry areas that has the requirement element in it to be filled in with and a submit button bellow it. 

I have a user data table with hard coded user data in it. The columns and rows are styled with bootstrap hover and color display to show you the different rows.  I added a picture that is responsive to the screen resizing and will fit smaller screens. I added a circular image right below that with bootstrap. Finally, I added two buttons the first and second buttons can be seen on any full and large sized screens the second one will disappear when the screen gets smaller.
